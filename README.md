# aerospike-benchmarks

The following assets allow easy reproduction of Aerospike's YCSB benchmarks, which
initially cover the performance of Aerospike 3.8.2 and Cassandra 3.5. YCSB is the standard tool
for measuring performance of high performance NoSQL databases.

These results and discussion of tuning parameters are covered in Aerospike's blog at
[http://www.aerospike.com/blog/comparing-nosql-databases-aerospike-and-cassandra/](http://www.aerospike.com/blog/comparing-nosql-databases-aerospike-and-cassandra/).

The following assets are provided: 
* Configuration files for Aerospike, Cassandra, and YCSB
* Workload files that were run
* Python scripts to generate good looking graphs

This repo will be updates with configuration and reproduction for other NoSQL databases
as Aerospike conducts more tests.
